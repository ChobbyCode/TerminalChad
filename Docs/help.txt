Welcome to TerminalChad!

TerminalChad is a Windows Powershell Terminal extension, that allows for easier use of the base Windows Terminal.
These features include:
	- Themes
	- Configuration
	- And More

To start with terminalchad, we must setup the application. This can be done with the 'TerminalChad setup' command. This creates the terminalchad directory in the appdata folder.

Once you have setup TerminalChad, you should first see some changes on the interface. This would make everything look slightly different.

Let's now set our own theme:

We can do this with the 'TerminalChad theme set ....' command. Let's just type 'TerminalChad theme set' to see what happens. 

As you see it gives up a list for what our themes are. For example, let's set the slick-dark theme. 'TerminalChad theme set slick-dark'

We can download more commands by using the command 'TerminalChad theme download', then we can provide a github url. For example, let's download the base terminalchad themes, we type the username of the person, and then a dot with the name of the repo. 'TerminalChad theme download ChobbyCode.TerminalChadThemes'.

If we want to redownload the base themes, we can type 'TerminalChad reload'


If we want to update the application we can type 'TerminalChadUpdate'
